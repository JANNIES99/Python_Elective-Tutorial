In college essays, paragraphs are typically longer and more detailed compared to high school essays. A general guideline is that each paragraph should be about 1/3 to 1/2 of a page, which is significantly longer than the typical high school paragraph. This length allows for a more in-depth exploration of each topic, including a topic sentence, supporting details, examples, and analysis.
